Modules are just a python files that we can use to import into our cuurent python file.

There are many modules that we can use to import
you can go to google & search for python module index
you will get multiple python modules
https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html
you can click on any module
eg base64
you can get the location of that file in first line
 Lib/base64.py

So let us see how we can use these modules
